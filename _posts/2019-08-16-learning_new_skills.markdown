I became interested in programming a few years ago when I was first exposed to data analysis at a previous job that I had. I had no idea what it was back then but I was very interested in learning and gaining these skills. Because of this, I decided to take a couple of programming classes online through my local community college. I feel like the classes only showed me the very basics so I was determined to learn more. I started looking online to learn more about programming in general and I came across Flatiron and a few other similar websites. Flatiron, however, caught my attention since it gave free access to the prework lessons which I started working on. Right away, I got really into software development and started enjoying what I was learning. I didn't get a chance to get through much of the prework because of other things I had going one at the time,  but I knew it was something I wanted to get back to one day. I came across Flatiron again this year, and decided to go for it. I am close to finishing my MBA, but I feel that gaining hard skills such as these will make me a more well rounded candidate. I am a person that likes to continuously be learning new things and so far, joining Flatiron has been a very good decision since I feel like am learning a lot, even though I am doing the self paced track. I really like all the support that is given by the Flatiron staff and fellow classmates.
